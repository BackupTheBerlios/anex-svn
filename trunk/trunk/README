Astro-Nex is a program to calculate and draw astrological charts in API method
style, under the GPL License.

It's written in python and gtk, using cairo as the drawing enngine.  
To calculate it uses data publicated by the Geospacial Agency, the timezone
database (pytz) and the swiss ephemeris.

All graphics reflects astrological concepts in the API method, so it's useful 
mainly to students and profesionals in this field.

It can export graphics to png and pdf, though it's strengths are in its
interactivity and easy of navigation in screen mode.
